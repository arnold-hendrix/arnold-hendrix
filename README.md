- 👋 Hi, my name is Arnold Masanga. 
- 👀 I’m interested in software development and IoT.
- 🌱 I’m currently in my last semester of a Computer Engineering degree at Seneca College, in Toronto.
      You will find mostly Python and .NET projects in my repository. I am planning to add IoT projects in the near future.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .NET and Python projects.
